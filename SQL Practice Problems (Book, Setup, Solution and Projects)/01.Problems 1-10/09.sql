-- 9.) Orders shipping to any country in Latin America
--   • Now, instead of just wanting to return all the orders from France of Belgium, we want to 
--     show all the orders from any Latin American country. But we don't have a list of Latin American 
--     countries in a table in the Northwind database. So, we're going to just use this list of Latin American 
--     countries that happen to be in the Orders table:
--     Brazil
--     Mexico
--     Argentina
--     Venezuela
--     It doesn't make sense to use multiple Or statements anymore, it would get too convoluted. Use the In statement.

SELECT order_id, customer_id, ship_country
FROM orders
WHERE ship_country IN ('Brazil','Mexico','Argentina','Venezuela');
